This will install the necessary dependencies and start a development server at `http://localhost:3000`

To deploy this project, you can use the static site hosting service of your choice. I chose to use GitHub Pages to host my site, which makes it easy to deploy updates using the gh-pages branch. You can learn more about deploying to GitHub Pages [here](https://pages.github.com/).
